Automations require a [Pro or Max subscription](https://1code.dev/pro). Learn more at [1code.dev/agents/async](https://1code.dev/agents/async).


## API

Run coding agents programmatically. Point at a repo, give it a task - the agent runs in a sandbox and delivers a PR.

```bash
curl -X POST https://1code.dev/api/v1/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "repository": "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo",
    "prompt": "Fix the failing CI tests"
  }'
```

- **Remote Sandboxes** - Isolated cloud environment, repo cloned, dependencies installed
- **Git & PR Integration** - Agent commits, pushes branches, opens PRs automatically
- **Async Execution** - Fire and forget, poll for status or get notified
- **Follow-up Messages** - Send additional instructions to a running task

bun install
bun run claude:download  # Download Claude binary (required!)
bun run build
bun run package:mac  # or package:win, package:linux
```

> **Important:** The `claude:download` step downloads the Claude CLI binary which is required for the agent chat to work. If you skip this step, the app will build but agent functionality won't work.
